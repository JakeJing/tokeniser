An assigment in Natural Language Processing (NPL) at Reykjavik University.

"In this project, you will develop a tokeniser and a sentence segmentiser
for a language of your choice. Actually, it would be best if your program
could handle a family of languages (instead of a single language), for exam-
ple the North Germanic languages: Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian, Danish
and Swedish. With language independence in mind, regular expressions for
matching abbreviations are preferred to an implementation using a list of
abbreviations."
